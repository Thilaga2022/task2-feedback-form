# task2-feedback-form

This is a simple feedback form I created as part of my coding practice. The form allows users to enter their name, email, and feedback, and it includes a live character count for the feedback textarea.

🌟 Features:
Clean and responsive layout

Live character counter for the feedback textarea

Submit button is enabled only when all fields are filled

Basic input validation using HTML and JavaScript

🚀 How to Run:
Open the index.html file in your browser.

Fill out the form and see the live character count in action.



📁 Files Included:
index.html – The main HTML structure

style.css – Styling for the form

script.js – Logic for live validation and character counting
